## Project Overview

The video game industry is one of the largest entertainment sectors in the world — yet the factors that determine whether a game succeeds are often unclear.  
This project analyzes a dataset of Steam games to uncover patterns and relationships between:

- Price  
- Genre  
- Release date  
- Developer type (indie vs. AAA)  
- User reviews and ratings  

The goal is to identify which characteristics are most strongly associated with highly rated or popular games.

##  Research Questions
1. Which genres tend to have the highest ratings?
2. Does game price affect user satisfaction?
3. How have player preferences changed over time?
4. Are indie games rated differently from major publisher titles?
