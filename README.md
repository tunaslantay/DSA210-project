# What Makes a Game Successful? 
### Analyzing Steam Game Data
This project explores which factors contribute to the success of video games on Steam, using data analysis and visualization.
## Project Overview
Video games are one of the largest entertainment industries in the world, but what makes a game successful?  
This project analyzes Steam game data to discover how price, genre, release dates and other factors effect game ratings and popularity.

##  Research Questions
1. Which genres tend to have the highest ratings?
2. Does game price affect user satisfaction?
3. How have player preferences changed over time?
4. Are indie games rated differently from major publisher titles?

##  Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset:** [Steam Games Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artermiloff/steam-games-dataset)
  
**Dataset Features Include:**
- Title, Developer, Publisher  
- Release Date  
- Price  
- Review Counts and Ratings

## Data Collection Plan
I plan to use publicly available game data from Kaggle and prepare it for analysis.  
If needed, I may combine additional sources to make the dataset more comprehensive.
